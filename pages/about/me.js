                This is mostly an experiement in getting out of my comfort zone. One of the ways
                I&apos;ll be doing that is sharing some of my intersts and side projects. I&apos;m
                also not a huge fan of talking about myself so this should be interesting. I suppose
                the good news is, this won&apos;t be read by too many ;)
            </p>
            <p>...more to come I suppose</p>
        </Layout>
